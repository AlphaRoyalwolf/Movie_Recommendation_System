This project is a comprehensive Movie Recommender System that employs various recommendation techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. The system utilizes demographic filtering, content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and singular value decomposition (SVD) to generate recommendations based on user preferences and movie attributes.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The dataset used for this project is analyzed to gain insights into its structure, features, and distributions. Exploratory Data Analysis helps in understanding the characteristics of the dataset and aids in feature selection and engineering.


## Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of the recommender system. In this project, the following techniques are employed:

- Demographic Filtering: Recommendations are based on user demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, etc.
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommendations are made by analyzing movie attributes such as plot description, credits, genres, and keywords.
- Plot Description-Based Filtering: Recommendations are generated by analyzing the plot descriptions of movies and suggesting similar ones.
- Credit, Genres, and Keywords-Based Recommender: Recommendations are based on movie credits, genres, and keywords.
- Collaborative Filtering: Recommendations are made based on user interactions and similarities with other users.
- Single Value Decomposition (SVD): Matrix factorization technique used for collaborative filtering.
- Comparison between SVD and SVDpp: Evaluation and comparison between different collaborative filtering methods.

## Conclusion

The Movie Recommender System aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and movie attributes. By utilizing various recommendation techniques and feature engineering approaches, the system enhances the user experience and increases engagement.

## Areas of Improvements (Future Work)

- Incorporating additional features such as movie ratings, release dates, and popularity scores for more accurate recommendations.
- Implementing deep learning-based recommendation models for improved performance.
- Enhancing the user interface and user experience for seamless interaction with the recommender system.
